## Update About Section Background Opacity

A simple styling change to match the About section's background overlay with the Portfolio ("Our Work") section for better visual separation from Contact.

### Change

| Section | Current | New |
|---------|---------|-----|
| About Us | `bg-background/80` | `bg-background/90` |

### File Modified

- `src/components/AboutSection.tsx` - Update the overlay div class from `bg-background/80` to `bg-background/90`

### Visual Result

This will make the About section slightly darker (matching the Portfolio section at 90% opacity), creating clearer visual separation between Contact and About sections.
